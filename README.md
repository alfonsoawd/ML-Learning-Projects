# Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and learning materials from different machine learning courses I've taken. Each folder is labeled to indicate the course:

**1-** : *Machine Learning for NLP* (Teacher: Christopher Kermorant)  
   - Covers classification tasks, word embeddings, and foundational NLP techniques.
   - Each subfolder (e.g. `1.1-`, `1.2-`) focuses on specific NLP topics like sentiment analysis, sequence models, or embeddings.

**2-** : *Machine Learning for Econometrics*  
   - Placeholder for future notebooks exploring regression analysis, time series forecasting, and causal inference in economic data contexts.
